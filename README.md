# Outfit-Generator
A personal project: making a web app that looks up the weather and suggests me what to wear from my capsule wardrobe. 

This project is still a work in progress HOWEVER, I consider it as a minimum viable product since it answers my needs quite sufficiently.

One can have a look at https://pierremichelhardy.shinyapps.io/Outfit_Generator/ and play around with it. 

Comments on the code and proper documentation are to be followed.
